# Discord bot

[Discord](https://discord.com) is a popular instant messaging social platform. You can communicate through text and voice inside a channel or guild. Discord bots allow a better and more automated experience and handle a wide variety of things like moderation, games, levelling, and more.

[Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) and [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) are two of the most popular API wrappers for Discord bots. A comprehensive listing of other community-maintained wrappers can be found [here](https://libs.advaith.io).

Discord bots are more of an intermediate project as most wrappers rely on concepts such as asynchronous programming, OOP (object-oriented programming), observer patterns, and more which can be complicated for newcomers. Documentation is the best place to learn about an Discord bot wrapper or anything really.

Some ideas for a Discord bot include:

- A bot that fetches posts from Reddit
- A dictionary or question bot using Wikipedia or Wolfram Alpha.
- A bot that keeps a list of user-made content (tags)
