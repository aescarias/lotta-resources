# Static Site Generator (SSG)

In simple terms, a static site generator compiles documents (generally Markdown) into static HTML files. They are often used in content-focused websites such as documentation, knowledge bases, and blogs. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), and [Astro](https://astro.build/) are examples of SSGs.

You will probably want to start with a Markdown-to-HTML converter. [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) is one of the most popular ones for Javascript, but [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) may be more suitable for more complex parsing needs.
