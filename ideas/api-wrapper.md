# API wrapper

Application programming interfaces (APIs) provide an easy way for developers to interact with anything and access data. There are many APIs for weather, maths, images, and more.

API wrappers are meant to abstract and ease the process of communicating with an API. Wrappers generally handle authentication, data modelling, and caching and ratelimiting.

Your goal is to write a wrapper around any API you please. This project can vary in difficulty depending on the API to implement. The [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) list is a good starter!
