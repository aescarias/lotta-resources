# Anything using the Github API

The Github [REST](https://docs.github.com/es/rest) and [GraphQL](https://docs.github.com/es/graphql) APIs provides easy access to many things from the Github website. It allows you to view repositories, users, issues, and more.

Some ideas using the Github API include:

- An activity tracker for discussions, pull requests or issues.
- An application for viewing information about users and repositories.
- A guessing game for gists or code snippets where you guess what language they were written in.
